### Expass3 report:


#### Step 1: Set up the Node project
- I managed to set up the project just fine. I decided to not use svelte-kit but rather just plain JavaScript.

### Step 2: Develop components
- What worked: Poll component for creating a new poll.
- What didn't work: Voting component and voting.

### Step 3 and 4: 
- I seemed to integrate the frontend and backend well using the Poll component.
- I had issues with the voting component. I had some issues relating to the backend that also made this hard to solve.
- (I also tried to do something with the user and had some issues with it I couldn't figure out. However that might not be important to the task and can be ignored.)

### Step 5:
- Didn't get to in time.

Summary:
- Creating and fetching polls seem to work fine.
- Voting did not work. It might require further backend work as well to make sense.
